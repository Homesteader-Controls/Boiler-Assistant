Boiler Commander Clone

Hello, 

I bet you landed here after seeing a bogus and illegally marketed product called Boiler Commander on Facebook or YouTube. Or perhaps you are just looking for a way to increase the efficiency of your outdoor wood boiler. 

Boiler commander is really a SUPER CHEAP to build setup using off the shelf parts found on amazon! The part making it illegal is that they are being used for their intended purposes while being marketed as some new invention that they are not, and illegally not disclosing the parts being used within, defrauding consumers by blurring out images and videos, and telling anyone they sucker into overpaying for their products to keep it all a secret, with statements such as "Joe told me not to open it or the magic will escape" being used in YouTube videos. These people that agree to this are simply becoming accessory to the crime. 

The point in this repo is to unveil the inner workings of the industrial controls being used in boiler commander because they are intended for this purpose and widely available at a LOW LOW cost compared to BCs $1000 SCAM price tag. There's a total of about $230 in parts needed to build a "Boiler Commander".

Additionally please contact us if you feel you have been scammed by these fraudsters as we are in the beginning phases of filing an FTC and Attorney general complaint for their deceptive and fraudulent advertising of commercially available products as if they were an invention.

Here is the link to purchase the temperature controller used in BC: $61 - https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/shopping/catalog/process_control_-a-_measurement/temperature_-z-_process_controllers/basic_temperature_controllers/slb4848-c2

You also need a temperature probe with a wide temperature range. K type sensors work well: about $10 - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OLIOTHM or https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09W9W2H5J

*Note: I personally opted for a full sized controller (sl9696-cre) with RS485 controls that cost slightly more but can be integrated with smart controls and used for data later. There's also a free Solo config and monitoring software that works with it.

Here is the Amazon link for the VFD they used: $89 - https://www.amazon.com/HKS-Variable-Frequency-Controller-Converter/dp/B09P31HL9B

This is not really the best VFD for the job here, just the cheapest they could get their hands on. I opted for a model with RS485 and more features (HY01D511B). 

Finally you'll need a box to put it in. Depending on your VFD choice, you may need a larger box, but there are buildable control panel boxes of all sizes on Amazon. Here's an example of a larger one: $79 -  https://www.amazon.com/TICONN-Waterproof-Electrical-Junction-Enclosure/dp/B0B87TNPRY 

Boiler commander also uses a digital thermostat(inkbird) to basically take the place of the existing one in your boiler. It's optional but adds graphs and wifi control if you don't plan to add any other smart features. Our later release of a smart boiler assistant will not use the inkbird.

Wiring diagrams and further configuration information is coming soon.
